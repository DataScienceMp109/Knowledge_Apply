This is an unsupervised problem because we are trying to discover
structure—in this case, distinct clusters—on the basis of a data set.
The goal in supervised problems, on the other hand, is to try to predict
some outcome vector such as survival time or response to drug treatment.

Clustering
Unsupervised Learning.

Definition:
Clustering refers to a very broad set of techniques for finding subgroups(unknown subgroups), or clustering
clusters, in a data set. When we cluster the observations of a data set, we
seek to partition them into distinct groups so that the observations within
each group are quite similar to each other, while observations in different
groups are quite different from each other.

Example:
* Our goal is to perform market segmentation by identifying
subgroups of people who might be more receptive to a particular form
of advertising.

* Perhaps there are a few different unknown
subtypes of breast cancer. Clustering could be used to find these
subgroups.


K-means clustering

Definition:
we seek to partition the observations into a pre-specified
number of clusters.

Formula and intuition refer to Introduction to statistical learning page 387 or 
from a web browser page 402.

Algorithm 10.1 K-Means Clustering
    1. Randomly assign a number, from 1 to K, to each of the observations.
        These serve as initial cluster assignments for the observations.
    2. Iterate until the cluster assignments stop changing:
        (a) For each of the K clusters, compute the cluster centroid. The
        kth cluster centroid is the vector of the p feature means for the
        observations in the kth cluster.
        (b) Assign each observation to the cluster whose centroid is closest
        (where closest is defined using Euclidean distance).
        
Because the K-means algorithm finds a local rather than a global optimum,
the results obtained will depend on the initial (random) cluster assignment
of each observation in Step 1 of Algorithm 10.1. For this reason,
it is important to run the algorithm multiple times from different random initial configurations.
